Last night I finished Life is Strange. After all this time with the game telling me that it was a game about choice and that the choices I make matter, it came down to one choice. A or B.

The art style didn't really work out. The textures are all painted, but there's no shaders to make models look painted. Skyward sword did this for the background, but not the foreground. The color scheme made the models in the foreground look okay. You couldn't do the shader in 480p without making the game too blurry, but I think it would work in HD.

I would write more about Life is Strange, but you should play it with no spoilers. The last episode has some _really_ great moments.
